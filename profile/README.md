# Conversa project

Access to information is increasingly conversational. However, there is a lack of conversational AI training material for Spanish and the co-official languages, in general and for specific key tasks and domains. Additional barriers include steep computational costs for training conversational agents and challenging inference times, and a lack of guarantees for the safety and transparency of conversational systems. The CONVERSA project (TED2021-132470B-I00) constitutes a step forward to democratize access to conversational AI through computation and data efficient development and testing of innovative, open and safe resources in Spanish and co-official languages. The duration of the project is from December 2022 to November 2024.

Our objective is to increase the availability of resources and models for conversational AI in Spanish, as well as the co-official languages of Spain: Basque, Catalan, and Galician. To achieve this, we are developing a comprehensive collection of dialogue datasets and offering tools that allow for the reproducible creation of corpora for each segment of the dataset. 

Apart from corpora we also create both dialogue and QA interactive systems in diverse domains.
