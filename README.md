# Conversa project

Access to information is increasingly conversational. However, there is a lack of conversational AI training material for Spanish and the co-official languages, in general and for specific key tasks and domains. Additional barriers include steep computational costs for training conversational agents and challenging inference times, and a lack of guarantees for the safety and transparency of conversational systems. The CONVERSA project (TED2021-132470B-I00) constitutes a step forward to democratize access to conversational AI through computation and data efficient development and testing of innovative, open and safe resources in Spanish and co-official languages. The duration of the project is from December 2022 to November 2024.
